# Golem

Golem enables users to buy and sell unused computing resources. This compute time can be used to process virtually any computationally-demanding task. Consequently, Golem creates the first global market for idle computing power. Golem is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network established by nodes running the Golem client software.
