# Golem

Golem enables users to buy and sell unused computing resources. This compute time can be used to process virtually any computationally-demanding task. Consequently, Golem creates the first global market for idle computing power. Golem is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network established by nodes running the Golem client software. 

Golem code is here: https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/
Testers may still add issues in this repository.

Golem software collects data on your system, hardware and usage. Data is sent to the development team and is used to help in further development of the network. We do not collect any private data.
